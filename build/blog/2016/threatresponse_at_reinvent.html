<h1>ThreatResponse at re: Invent</h1>

<p>Things have been quiet on the blog through Amazon re: Invent.  It&rsquo;s not due to the fact that we don&rsquo;t want to blog!  <strong>We want to update you on what&rsquo;s going on with ThreatResponse and the IR tools.</strong></p>

<p>There&rsquo;s been so much great content here at Amazon re: Invent.</p>

<h2>What&rsquo;s going on with ThreatResponse?</h2>

<p>We&rsquo;re in the process of some major refactor of our tool suite!  A few things are broken at the moment.  Check out our development branches though for latest features and what we&rsquo;re working toward.</p>

<p><strong>Here are my personal highlights from the conference:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Monday : Security Jam</li>
<li>Tuesday : Beetle Bailey&rsquo;s presentation &ldquo;&rdquo;</li>
</ul>

<h2>Security Jam</h2>

<p>I made a point to attend the <em>Security Jam</em> a security simulation exercise where I competed with 200 other attendees in a defensive CTF locking down servers and serverless architecture.  </p>

<p><em>A big surprise</em> !</p>

<p><img alt="marhso-sirs" src="threatresponse_at_reinvent/marsho-4ea41f9b.png" /></p>

<p>A ThreatResponse tool was featured in one of the CTF Challenges.  We were so excited!  Special thanks to the challenge designer.</p>

<h2>Security Automation</h2>

<p>I attended the latest incarnation of Don &ldquo;Beetle&rdquo; Bailey&rsquo;s presentation SEC313 ( I&rsquo;ll link it here when it&rsquo;s posted online. )  During this presentation we were dazzled by automated penetration tests using the Dash Developer Button https://aws.amazon.com/iotbutton/ and wow&#39;ed by the first live demo of a security-tool suite for the Amazon Echo-Dot powered by Alexa.  Beetle and team demonstrated running Amazon Inspector via Alexa to show off <em>what is possible</em>.</p>

<p>I was even inspired to try and re-create the demo for all of you.  After a few minutes of reading I discovered the ease of creating an Alex Skill.  <strong>Look for future blogs on building your own Jarvis with Alexa</strong>.  </p>

<p><strong>See it on youtube in action</strong></p>

<p>We got another big surprise and huge compliment being mentioned as a &ldquo;Cool&rdquo; project in SEC313.  </p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Long story short re: Invent continues to be better than I ever expected.  Three words <em>uplifting, educating, and inspring!</em> In a lot of ways this is the anniversary of ThreatResponse since ThreatResponse was inspired by a Don &ldquo;Beetle&rdquo; Bailey presentation on Security Automation.  </p>
