# ThreatResponse at re: Invent

Things have been quiet on the blog through Amazon re: Invent.  It's not due to the fact that we don't want to blog!  __We want to update you on what's going on with ThreatResponse and the IR tools.__

There's been so much great content here at Amazon re: Invent.

## What's going on with ThreatResponse?

We're in the process of some major refactor of our tool suite!  A few things are broken at the moment.  Check out our development branches though for latest features and what we're working toward.

__Here are my personal highlights from the conference:__

* Monday : Security Jam
* Tuesday : Beetle Bailey's presentation ""


## Security Jam

I made a point to attend the _Security Jam_ a security simulation exercise where I competed with 200 other attendees in a defensive CTF locking down servers and serverless architecture.  

_A big surprise_ !

A ThreatResponse tool was featured in one of the CTF Challenges.  We were so excited!  Special thanks to the challenge designer.

## Security Automation

I attended the latest incarnation of Don "Beetle" Bailey's presentation SEC313 ( I'll link it here when it's posted online. )  During this presentation we were dazzled by automated penetration tests using the Dash Developer Button https://aws.amazon.com/iotbutton/ and wow'ed by the first live demo of a security-tool suite for the Amazon Echo-Dot powered by Alexa.  Beetle and team demonstrated running Amazon Inspector via Alexa to show off _what is possible_.

I was even inspired to try and re-create the demo for all of you.  After a few minutes of reading I discovered the ease of creating an Alex Skill.  __Look for future blogs on building your own Jarvis with Alexa__.

__See it on youtube in action__

We got another big surprise and huge compliment being mentioned as a "Cool" project in SEC313.

## Conclusion

Long story short re: Invent continues to be better than I ever expected.  Three words _uplifting, educating, and inspring!_ In a lot of ways this is the anniversary of ThreatResponse since ThreatResponse was inspired by a Don "Beetle" Bailey presentation on Security Automation.
